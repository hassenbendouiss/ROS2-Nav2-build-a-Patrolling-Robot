This repository contains code and instructions for building a patrolling robot using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) and Nav2 (Navigation2). 

The goal of this project is to create a robot capable of autonomously patrolling an environment while avoiding obstacles. We achieve this by leveraging ROS 2, which provides a framework for building robotic systems, and Nav2, a navigation stack built on top of ROS 2.
